# Adafruit Bus IO Library [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO/actions)

## FORK

This Library is a fork of the Adafruit with the express reason to provide support for the Feather OLED based on the SH1107 chip. This is the
only library I have found which will provide a working solution for this implementation.

This is a helper library to abstract away I2C & SPI transactions and registers
