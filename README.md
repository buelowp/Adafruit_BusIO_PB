# Adafruit Bus IO Library

## FORK

This Library is a fork of the Adafruit with the express reason to provide support for the Feather OLED based on the SH1107 chip. This is the
only library I have found which will provide a working solution for this implementation.

## Original Text

This is a helper library to abstract away I2C & SPI transactions and registers
